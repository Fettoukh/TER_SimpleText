Training frequency is considered an important variable in the hypertrophic response to regimented resistance exercise.,hypertrophic,,1
The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies designed to investigate the effects of weekly training frequency on hypertrophic adaptations.,hypertrophic,,1
"Forced repetitions/drop sets, supersets, and heavy negatives, in particular, have been purported to enhance the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise.",hypertrophic,,1
"Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for hypertrophic gains.",hypertrophic,,1
"According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells before hypertrophic growth.",hypertrophic,,1
"Maximizing the hypertrophic response to resistance training (RT) is thought to be best achieved by proper manipulation of exercise program variables including exercise selection, exercise order, length of rest intervals, intensity of maximal load, and training volume.",hypertrophic,,1
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether alterations in repetition duration can amplify the hypertrophic response to RT.,hypertrophic,,1
Results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s.,hypertrophic,,1
"However, these methods are probably better at inducing hypertrophy than muscular strength, and more research is needed on longitudinal training effects.",hypertrophy,,1
"In conclusion, there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not significantly or meaningfully impact muscle hypertrophy when volume is equated.",hypertrophy,,1
This article will explore the potential role of these techniques in promoting muscle hypertrophy and provide an insight into possible applications to resistance training programs.,hypertrophy,,1
"Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to extensively review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and (b) to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal protocol for maximizing muscle growth.",hypertrophy,,1
"In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely the lack of direct evidence that muscle hypertrophy from exercise plays an important role in increasing strength.",hypertrophy,,1
Low-intensity occlusion (50-100 mm hg) training provides a unique beneficial training mode for promoting muscle hypertrophy.,hypertrophy,,1
Training at intensities as low as 20% 1 repetition maximum with moderate vascular occlusion results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as 3 weeks.,hypertrophy,,1
Training at intensities as low as 20% 1 repetition maximum with moderate vascular occlusion results in muscle hypertrophy in as little as 3 weeks.,hypertrophy,,1
We and others have demonstrated that aerobic exercise acutely and chronically alters protein metabolism and induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy.,hypertrophy,,1
"Moreover, some researches indicate that stretch training may induce muscle hypertrophy; however, studies on the topic have been primarily relegated to animal and in vitro models.",hypertrophy,,1
"In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to confer beneficial changes in muscle size and architecture; alternatively, albeit limited evidence suggests that when stretching is done with a certain degree of tensile strain (particularly when loaded, or added between active muscle contractions) may elicit muscle hypertrophy.",hypertrophy,,1
It is plausible that cycle training requires a longer period to significantly increase muscle size compared to typical resistance training due to a much slower hypertrophy rate.,hypertrophy,,1
"Cycle training induces muscle hypertrophy similarly between young and older age groups, while strength gain seems to favor older adults, which suggests that the probability for improving in muscle quality appears to be higher in older adults compared to young adults.",hypertrophy,,1
It also appears that muscle hypertrophy induced by cycle training results from the positive changes in muscle protein net balance.,hypertrophy,,1
"However, the majority of available evidence supports a clear dose-response relationship between resistance training volume and physiological responses, such as muscle hypertrophy and health outcomes.",hypertrophy,,1
"The overarching principle argued herein is that volume is the most easily modifiable variable that has the most evidenced-based response with important repercussions, be these muscle hypertrophy or health-related outcomes.",hypertrophy,,1
"Although the effects of short versus long inter-set rest intervals in resistance training on measures of muscle hypertrophy have been investigated in several studies, the findings are equivocal and the practical implications remain unclear.",hypertrophy,,1
Current evidence indicates that both short and long inter-set rest intervals may be useful when training for achieving gains in muscle hypertrophy.,hypertrophy,,1
Novel findings involving trained participants using measures sensitive to detect changes in muscle hypertrophy suggest a possible advantage for the use of long rest intervals to elicit hypertrophic effects.,hypertrophy,,1
"This review describes a cellular memory in skeletal muscle in which hypertrophy is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has previously been large, but subsequently lost its mass, can regain mass faster than naive fibres.",hypertrophy,,1
"Findings suggest that training at volitionally very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is inferior from a hypertrophy standpoint, although a lack of controlled studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.",hypertrophy,,1
"Primary emphasis will be placed on the hypotensive effect of aerobic and resistance exercise and associated mechanisms that have clinical relevance, but if left unchecked, can progress to symptomatic hypotension and syncope.",hypotension,,1

"Blood, cell signaling and mRNA data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (two factor: time × treatment) with repeated measures and myofibrillar protein synthesis was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with repeated measures.",protein synthesis,,1
"The first novel finding of this study was that mTOR signaling and rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) following concurrent resistance, continuous and intermittent high-intensity exercise, designed to mimic the metabolic profile of many team sports, were impaired during the early (8 h) recovery phase by the ingestion of large amounts (1.5 g•kg?1 BM) of alcohol.",protein synthesis,,1
